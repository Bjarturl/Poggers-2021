# POGGERS 2021 frontend
Fetches data from the backend and creates a cool little dashboard-ish thingy.
The page is served at https://poggers2021.netlify.app/ for now but will probably later be moved to https://2021.poggers.is
Deploys to the main branch will automatically build the project on Netlify
## Project setup

yarn install 
```
